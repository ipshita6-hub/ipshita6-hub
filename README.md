  Hi there👋, I'm Ipshita — Learning, Experimenting and Improving ✨
</h2>

<p align="center">
  I am currently working on AI/ML and full-stack projects using Python, React, Node.js, and MongoDB. Interested in collaborating on open-source initiatives, machine learning applications, and beginner-friendly hackathons. Also seeking guidance on improving machine learning model performance and designing scalable backend systems. At present, learning core machine learning algorithms, advanced React concepts, and system design fundamentals. You can ask me about ML basics, GitHub workflows, React development, or effective project structuring. I enjoy transforming academic assignments into practical, real-world projects.
